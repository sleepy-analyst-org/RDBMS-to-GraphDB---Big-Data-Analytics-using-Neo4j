# RDBMS to GraphDB - Big Data Analytics using Neo4j

## Introduction 
The "RDBMS to GraphDB - Big Data Analytics using Neo4j" project aims to solve various business-critical questions using graph database technology. By migrating from a traditional relational database management system (RDBMS) to Neo4j, a graph database, the project provides a more efficient and effective way to analyze big data and drive product strategy.

Through this project, the following questions are addressed:

- The employees who sold Tofu and the count of orders for each employee are listed.
- The products that were sold along with Tofu are identified.
- The total number of products in the dataset is determined.
- The top 5 products by sales are ranked.
- The category with the highest sales is identified and the products in that category are listed.

With the implementation of Neo4j, the project demonstrates the power of graph databases in managing big data and providing insights for decision making.

## Tools Used 
- Neo4j
- RDBMS
